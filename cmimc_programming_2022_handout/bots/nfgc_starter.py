    "yesterday": [] on first day, otherwise a 2D list, where each element is
        [c_1, c_2, ..., c_10] for a specific player.
        The order of the players remains consistent in this list.
    "scores": A list of all playersâ€™ current total money made.
        The order of the players here matches that of "yesterday".

        summing to at most 100.
